# simulant_templates

## Summary:

A series of template projects for getting you started in the simulant engine. All templates are still WIP, and do not function

## Templates:

- third_person_example (WIP): Example of a behind the player player third person camera controller
- first_person_example (Not Implemented): Example of a first person camera controller
- top_down_example (Not Implemented): Example of a top down camera system

## Setup:
1. Install Simulant-Engine (KallistiOS/KOS not required)
2. Clone Repository into your favorite folder
3. Enter the example you want to start with, and type the command ```simulant update``` in order to add the compiler system
4. If you want to try out the sample "as is" then:
   - For Windows: ```simulant build windows```
   - For Linux: ```simulant build linux```
   - For Dreamcast: ```simulant package dreamcast```
5. copy the build folder to your OS of choice and run it. (For Dreamcast, use an emulator, burn a disc, or use a GDemu with the generated CDI file)

## Todo:
- Code "third_person_example"
- Implement "first_person_example"
- Implement "top_down_example"
- Add player model
- Add detailed documentation
- Add other example maps
